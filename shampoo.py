"""
"""
Differencing is a method of transforming a time series dataset. 
It can be used to remove the series dependence on time, so-called temporal dependence. 
This includes structures like trends and seasonality. Differencing can help stabilize the mean
of the time series by removing changes in the level of a time series, and so eliminating (or reducing) 
trend and seasonality.
Differencing is performed by subtracting the previous observation from the current observation.

A nonseasonal ARIMA model is classified as an “ARIMA(p,d,q)” model, where:

p is the number of autoregressive terms,
d is the number of nonseasonal differences needed for stationarity, and
q is the number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation.
Values of p and q come through ACF and PACF plots. So let us understand both ACF and PACF!
