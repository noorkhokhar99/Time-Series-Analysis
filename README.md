# Time Series Analysis

**Time series forecasting** is a technique for the prediction of events through a sequence of time. The technique is used across many fields of study, from geology to behaviour to economics. The techniques predict future events by analyzing the trends of the past, on the assumption that future trends will hold similar to historical trends.
