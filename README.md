# Introduction

“Time series models are used to forecast future events based on previous events that have been observed (and data collected) at regular time intervals.”

We will be taking a small forecasting problem and try to solve it till the end learning time series forecasting alongside.


# What is Time Series analysis?

Time series forecasting is a technique for the prediction of events through a sequence of time. The technique is used across many fields of study, from geology to behaviour to economics. The techniques predict future events by analyzing the trends of the past, on the assumption that future trends will hold similar to historical trends.


Time series forecasting is performed in a variety of applications including:

Weather forecasting

Earthquake prediction

Astronomy

Statistics

Mathematical finance

Econometrics

Pattern recognition

Signal processing

Control engineering

Time series forecasting is sometimes just the analysis of experts studying a field and offering their predictions. In many modern applications, however, time series forecasting uses computer technologies, including:

Machine learning

Artificial neural networks

Support vector machines

Fuzzy logic

Gaussian processes

Hidden Markov models

There are two main goals of time series analysis: (a) identifying the nature of the phenomenon represented by the sequence of observations, and (b) forecasting (predicting future values of the time series variable). Both of these goals require that the pattern of observed time series data is identified and more or less formally described. Once the pattern is established, we can interpret and integrate it with other data (i.e., use it in our theory of the investigated phenomenon, e.g., seasonal commodity prices). Regardless of the depth of our understanding and the validity of our interpretation (theory) of the phenomenon, we can extrapolate the identified pattern to predict future events.


Stages in Time Series Forecasting

Solving a time series problem is a little different as compared to a regular modeling task. A simple/basic journey of solving a time series problem can be demonstrated through the following processes. We will understand about tasks which one needs to perform in every stage. 


We will also look at the python implementation of each stage of our problem-solving journey.
