One such method for this task is differencing!

"""
Differencing is a method of transforming a time series dataset. 
It can be used to remove the series dependence on time, so-called temporal dependence. 
This includes structures like trends and seasonality. Differencing can help stabilize the mean
of the time series by removing changes in the level of a time series, and so eliminating (or reducing) 
trend and seasonality.
Differencing is performed by subtracting the previous observation from the current observation.

"""
Before we go on to build our forecasting model, 
we need to determine optimal parameters for our model. For those optimal parameters, we need ACF and PACF plots.

A nonseasonal ARIMA model is classified as an “ARIMA(p,d,q)” model, where:

p is the number of autoregressive terms,
d is the number of nonseasonal differences needed for stationarity, and
q is the number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation.
Values of p and q come through ACF and PACF plots. So let us understand both ACF and PACF!
